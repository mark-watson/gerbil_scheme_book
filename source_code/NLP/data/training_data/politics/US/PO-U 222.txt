Reuters PhotoDUBAI (Reuters) - President Bush has praised Saudi Arabia's cooperation in combating terrorist groups whose aim, he said, was to drive a wedge between the two allies, the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported on Friday. 

U.S.-Saudi relations have been in the spotlight since the September 11 suicide plane attacks. Washington blamed Saudi-born dissident Osama bin Laden for the attacks and said 15 of the 19 hijackers who crashed jets into the Pentagon and World Trade Center were Saudis. 

"Allow me to express to you once again my appreciation for the support your government extended since September 11 within our joint war against terrorist powers which seek to divide us," the Arabic-language SPA quoted Bush as saying in a letter to King Fahd. 

Bush sent the letter to mark the Eid al-Adha Muslim holiday. 

The agency said King Fahd replied by saying he was confident that the "regrettable terrorist events would not in any way affect our historic relationship with the friendly American people." 

The oil-rich kingdom has condemned the attacks and Saudi officials have said that the Saudis implicated in the attacks were unwitting victims of bin Laden, who has long demanded the expulsion of U.S. forces from Saudi Arabia, birthplace of Islam. 

Saudi Arabia has been widely blamed in the United States for not granting immediate U.S. access to an air base for the Afghan war and for not moving quickly to shut down funding channels for bin Laden's al Qaeda network and other extremist groups. 

Some U.S. columnists and senators say the conservative kingdom's system of government, religious institutions and education promote Islamic militancy. 

Riyadh has repeatedly said it backs the intelligence and financial crackdown on groups suspected of links to the September 11 attacks. 

U.S.-Saudi ties are heavily influenced by interlocking interests in oil, weapons and regional security.
