Sharon remarks draw U.S. rebuke WASHINGTON - Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon received an unusual rebuke from the United States as Secretary of State Colin Powell on Wednesday challenged the Israeli prime minister's statements this week that only if Israel continued to increase the other side's losses would the Palestinians sit down to talks."Prime Minister Sharon has to take a hard look at his policies to see whether they will work," Powell told a congressional committee. "If you declare war on the Palestinians and think you can solve the problem by seeing how many Palestinians can be killed - I don't know that leads us anywhere."For several months now, the Bush administration has focused most of its criticism exclusively at Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, insisting that he could do more to curb terrorism. But after waves of killing over the past week, Powell, who spoke by telephone Tuesday with Sharon, said both sides were pursuing policies that would only feed greater violence.In response to Powell's remarks, Sharon's office issued a statement saying that the war was imposed on Israel by the Palestinian Authority."Israel is only fighting back against the terrorist organization in the context of its right to self-defense," the statement said. "The one who initiated this war has the power to stop it, but he continues to prefer the war of terrorism."Sharon also announced that he was postponing a trip to Britain and Spain next week.
