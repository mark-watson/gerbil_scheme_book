Home Depot profit rises 53 percentFourth quarter results boosted by strength in home salesATLANTA, Feb 26 Home Depot Inc., the No. 1 home-improvement retailer, on Tuesday said its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings rose 53 percent on strength in the U.S. housing market and mild weather.       FOR THE QUARTER, ended Feb. 3, Atlanta-based Home Depot had net income of $710 million, or 30 cents a diluted share, compared with $465 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier.       Home Depot also said it expects to meet the current Wall Street consensus earnings estimate of 32 cents a share for the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Analysts' consensus earnings estimate for the fourth quarter was 28 cents a share, according to research firm Thomson Financial/First Call. 			       Sales rose 29 percent to $13.5 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year - "same-store" sales, an important retail barometer - rose 5 percent, compared with flat sales a year earlier.       On Monday, Home Depot rival Lowe's Cos. reported a 55 percent rise in fourth-quarter earnings and forecast that fiscal 2002 profits would surpass analysts' estimates.Brandes give thumbs-down to $21.7 billion acquisitionFeb. 26 - Hewlett-Packard Co. faces another vote against its plan to buy Compaq Computer Corp. Brandes Investment Partners LP, a money-management firm that held about 1.3% of H-P's shares at the end of 2001, said it plans to vote against H-P's proposed $21.7 billion acquisition of Compaq.		       BRANDES'S DISCLOSURE COMES just three weeks before a March 19 shareholder vote on the proposed transaction. San Diego-based Brandes owned 24.7 million H-P shares as of Dec. 31, making it the 12th-largest institutional holder of the Palo Alto, Calif., technology company's shares. The Hewlett and Packard families and their charitable foundations have already said they will vote their combined 18% holdings against the deal.       "Putting H-P together with Compaq is a gutsy and bold move," said Vinit Bodas, a partner and senior analyst at Brandes, which manages assets totaling $60 billion. "But our sense is that there are a lot of risks in doing that, including considerable cultural and integration risks." Instead, Mr. Bodas said, he favors a stand-alone H-P that will "focus and execute" on its enterprise offerings and consider a spinoff of its printer and imaging unit, an alternative plan that has also been championed by dissident H-P director Walter Hewlett. "That will bring the highest value to our shareholders," Mr. Bodas said.       An H-P spokeswoman said of Brandes's decision, "Clearly, we're disappointed, but we have many investors who support this deal." 			       Brandes's opposition comes just as the proposed acquisition was enjoying a favorable swing in momentum. In mid-January, Alliance Capital Management Holding LP, one of H-P's top 10 institutional shareholders, said it would vote for the transaction. Compaq Chief Executive Michael Capellas also recently said that Putnam Investments, a unit of Marsh & McLennan Cos. and another large H-P shareholder, supports the deal, though Putnam has declined to comment. Earlier this month, H-P Chief Executive Carly Fiorina said the company had enough shareholder support for the deal to go through. H-P needs a simple majority of votes that are cast for the deal to be approved.       Several other institutional shareholders have come out in favor of the deal. L. Roy Papp Associates, a Phoenix money-management firm that owns about 815,000 H-P shares, or 0.04% , said it will vote for the transaction. "Buying another company is a faster" way to improve H-P, said Rose Papp, the firm's director of research.       Others are now coming out against it. Victory Capital Management, which owns nearly seven million H-P shares, or 0.36%, disclosed this month it plans to vote against the deal. "Generally speaking, technology mergers haven't worked," said Vince Farrell, chairman of Victory Capital, based in Cleveland. "Why dilute H-P's return on investment by taking on a low-return [personal computing] business from Compaq?" 	Brandes's Mr. Bodas said the money-management firm began buying H-P stock in September after the deal was proposed and continued buying shares through October. Prior to September, Brandes hadn't owned any H-P shares. But the company, which typically buys deeply discounted stocks for its portfolios, decided H-P "was just too cheap," he said. Brandes was also attracted to the value offered by H-P's printing and imaging unit, which Mr. Bodas said also provided a floor to the stock price. Brandes began evaluating how to vote its H-P shares after Mr. Hewlett declared his opposition to the acquisition late last year. Over the course of the evaluation, Mr. Bodas said, he spoke with Ms. Fiorina and H-P Chief Financial Officer Bob Wayman, as well as with Mr. Hewlett and the Packard Foundation, which opposes the deal. "We went through an exhaustive process, and Walter Hewlett's alternative of a refocus on the enterprise business, with a serious look at spinning off the printer business is the best value alternative," Mr. Bodas said. At Brandes's investment committee meeting on Friday, the 12-person committee voted unanimously to oppose the deal, Mr. Bodas said. 	       It is unclear whether other money managers will follow Brandes's decision. Some fund-management companies such as Safeco Asset Management and T. Rowe Price Associates, a unit of T. Rowe Price Group Inc., said they will have individual money managers decide which way to vote their H-P shares, rather than make a companywide assessment. "Some money-management firms have 10 or 20 portfolios where each manager will vote differently, so it's very difficult to track down," said Kimberly Alexy, an analyst at Prudential Securities. She puts the odds of the transaction going through at 45%, up from 30% at the start of the year.       Many money managers are also still waiting on a potential swing factor: A recommendation for or against the deal from Institutional Shareholder Services. Known as ISS, the Rockville, Md., company, which specializes in corporate governance issues, has the ability to influence a wide swath of investors. Several fund managers have said they will simply vote their H-P shares based on ISS's evaluation; other money-management firms like Barclays Global Investors have arranged for ISS to vote their H-P shares on behalf of them. A recommendation from ISS on the deal is expected within the next two weeks.Consumer confidence data, Enron testimony in focusFeb. 26 - Stocks climbed modestly at the start of Tuesday's trading session, extending the previous day's strong rally, as investors braced for data on U.S. consumer confidence and more congressional testimony on the Enron affair.       IN EARLY TRADING, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 39 points after rallying 178 points on Monday and closing at 10,145.71, finishing at its highest level in more than six weeks and above 10,000 for the first time since Feb. 14.       The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index was up around 17 points after finishing 45 points higher on Monday, or up 2.6 percent, at 1,770.       Some positive earnings reports from the likes of Dow component General Motors and wireless technology firm Qualcomm, coupled with data that show a record rise in home sales in January, propelled the market's main indices sharply higher on Monday.        The real estate theme continued on Tuesday. Before the opening bell, Dow component Home Depot said its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings rose 53 percent thanks to strength in the U.S. housing market. The number-one home-improvement retailer also said it expects to meet Wall Street's earnings estimate for the first quarter of fiscal 2002.       And luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers said its first-quarter earnings rose, spurred by rising consumer confidence and growth in the number of affluent households. Toll Brothers also said it expects earnings to beat expectations for fiscal years 2002 and 2003.  Choose an option from the listName	Volume	Price	Change	Percent ChangeEMC Corporation	6,260,100

to show a decline. Investors are paying close attention to the data because consumer spending represents two-thirds of U.S. economic activity and has remained resilient, despite the current recession.       Also Tuesday, former Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling and Enron whistleblower Sherron Watkins will both appear before the Senate Commerce Committee today to testify about the demise of the former energy trader. Enron filed for bankruptcy last December. Skilling, Watkins to testify Tuesday       Investors will be examining Global Crossing's finances later Tuesday as the former fiber-optic favorite releases its fourth-quarter earnings. When the firm filed for bankruptcy protection last month it listed $22 billion in assets, but it may be valued at $1 billion to $2 billion, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. 	Local business news¥	News from your back yard and local angles nationwide       In other company news, appliance maker Whirlpool said it expects earnings for the first quarter to rise 15 to 20 percent from year-ago levels and expects earnings per share to grow 5 to 10 percent in 2002.       And Starbucks said on Tuesday it plans its first foray into Latin America with a coffee shop in Mexico. The coffee purveyor also said its 2002 earnings will be in line with Wall Street's estimates.       Investors will have more economic data to pore over later this week, including a report on January durable goods orders and a manufacturing sector survey from the Institute for Supply Management (previously the National Association of Purchasing Management).       On Wednesday, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will deliver his semiannual report on monetary policy before the House Financial Services Committee. 		       Wall Street is hoping the Fed chief can see an end to the current recession. Recent economic data have been slightly more positive, indicating some improvement in the U.S. economy, but some economists worry the economy could deteriorate further before it gets better.       On Thursday, the government will issue its report on fourth-quarter gross domestic product, or GDP, which is the broadest measure of all the goods and services produced in the U.S. economy. The GDP number is expected to rise from the initial 0.2 percent reading.       On Monday, General Motors raised its earnings estimates for the first quarter and full calendar year and said it will produce 1.5 percent more vehicles than previously planned in early 2002. And Qualcomm said it expects earnings in its second quarter to be in line with analysts' expectations and also said chip shipments met the high end of targets.        Also, the National Association of Realtors said sales of single-family homes surged to a record high of 16.2 percent in January, the largest single monthly increase on record and much higher than Wall Street had expected. 	       The main European stock markets were trading higher Tuesday. In Tokyo, doubts about Japan's anti-deflation plan drove stock prices lower, adding to Monday's decline. The benchmark Nikkei 225-share average closed down 93.84 points, or 0.91 percent, after losing 0.58 percent on Monday.       Bonds fell. The 10-year Treasury note was down 3/32 point, and its yield, which moves inversely to its price, rose to 4.87 percent. The 30-year bond was down 5/32 point, yielding 5.38 percent.       The dollar advanced, trading at 86.82 cents to the euro and 133.98 yen to the dollar, compared with 86.92 cents and 133.86 yen late Monday in New York.NEW YORK (Reuters) - American Express Co. AXP.N on Monday said computer giant International Business Machines Corp. IBM.N will take over a large part of its technology in a $4 billion, seven-year deal aimed at saving the global financial services firm hundreds of millions of dollars. New York-based American Express, known for its travelers checks and signature green and gold charge cards, said IBM will offer posts to about 2,000 employees as part of the agreement. The deal includes transferring to IBM the data center processing for more than 1 billion daily American Express transactions, hosting the company's Web site, network servers, data storage and help desk support. "It's not the biggest outsourcing deal in terms of value but it certainly ranks up there with the top 10 that have ever been awarded," said Gartner analyst Bruce Caldwell. "American Express is a real plum in terms of its data center. It's one of the largest in the world and one of the best managed," Caldwell said. The change comes after American Express on Jan. 28 posted a 56-percent falloff in fourth-quarter net income, as the global travel slump and the U.S. recession hurt its charge card, travel and money management units. IBM Global Services accounted for about 40 percent of its parent's revenue in the fourth quarter of 2001 and in recent years has been the No. 1 growth driver for the computer maker. In the fourth quarter, however, the company said services revenue declined 1 percent due to the economic slowdown. That slowdown has weighed on IBM's stock as analysts question how the company will improve its revenue growth in 2002. IBM Chief Operating Officer Samuel Palmisano, a former services head, will take over for Chief Executive Louis Gerstner on Friday. 'PAY-AS-YOU-GO' ASPECT OF DEAL The American Express agreement is IBM's largest and based in part on the "on-demand" services model introduced in the fall of 2000, in which a company's monthly payments vary as its need for computing expands and contracts. IBM said that means that if American Express needs more computing power because of increased financial transactions, for instance, IBM can respond by tapping into computers in one of its locations. "In the utility environment, if for one hour I need more capacity and I don't the next hour, I don't pay for it, whereas in a traditional arrangement typically you'd say 'we're going to need more so sign me up for "X" amount more for a period of time,"' said Ginni Rometty, general manager for IBM Global Services for the Americas. Rometty said the $4 billion figure is the minimum American Express expects to spend during seven years. "They outsource the heavy lifting to IBM but this is really new. Pay as you go ... is the future of services in this country," said Sam Albert of Sam Albert Associates, a consultancy in Scarsdale, New York. U.S. operations, which account for about 75 percent of the 2,000 positions, should start transferring to the new systems in March, and international ones in May, American Express said. An American Express spokeswoman said less than 20 American Express jobs would be cut in relation to the change. North American services revenue is expected to total $295.3 billion in 2002, of which comprehensive managed services, or outsourcing, will account for $113.5 billion, according to Gartner. IBM shares were up 45 cents at $98.90 and American Express was up $1.40 or just over 4 percent at $35.05 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. IBM shares have lost 18 percent this year and American Express has fallen less than 2 percent while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up about 1 percent. (c) Copyright Reuters 2001.

January's sales surge was also the largest documented, surpassing a 13 percent boost seen in May 1995. January's pace crushed forecasts of analysts polled by Reuters, who had expected a rate of 5.25 million units. Residential real estate has been a pillar of strength in an economy that fell into recession in March but has shown signs of recovery recently. A record 5.30 million pre-owned homes were sold last year, NAR said. NAR Chief Economist David Lereah said January's burst in sales could be a monthly aberration, but commented that many factors supported a strong performance. Mortgage interest rates are low, as is the number of homes for sale on the market, and the mild winter has favored house hunting, he said. Also, the willingness of consumers to purchase big ticket items, dented by the Sept. 11 attacks, may have picked up following the successful U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan, he added. "The fundamentals all lined up the right way," he said. The median sales price for U.S. existing homes rose 10.1 percent from a year earlier to $151,100 in January. Meanwhile, the number of homes for sale fell to a 4.1 months' supply at the current sales pace from 4.2 months' worth in December. Lereah said he does not believe the strong residential real estate performance has led to a home price bubble on a national level -- though some regions may experience price drops. "Inventory numbers are relatively lean," he said. Lean inventories indicate that prices have not risen to a level out of line with the demand for houses. Also, in spite of increases in home values, the relationship of median house prices to median household incomes is solidly in the middle of the historical range, Salomon's Wiegand said. "Prices are pretty much right on the average," he said. Existing homes sold at record rates in all regions of the country in January, NAR said. The sales pace rose 16.1 percent from December's level in the South, the region with the greatest number of sales. In the West, the next busiest region, sales jumped 23.3 percent, while they increased 8.3 percent in the Midwest and 16.4 percent in the Northeast. The average interest rate on the popular 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell for the third straight week last week to 6.81 percent, according to mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac FRE.N. With inflation low, the prospect of higher interest rates is dim, Freddie Mac economists said last week. (c) Copyright Reuters 2001. All rights reserved.

QCOM.O, home products retailer Williams-Sonoma Inc. WSM.N and automaking giant General Motors Corp. GM.N. "There are positives out there that you just haven't seen recently," said Barry Berman, head of equity trading for Robert W. Baird & Co. "The existing home sales data bodes well for other economic reports coming out later this week." The broad Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX rose 19.59 points, or 1.80 percent, to 1,109.43, its largest daily percentage gain since early December. The technology-laced Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC surged 45.34 points, or 2.63 percent, to 1,769.88 -- its biggest one-day percentage gain since Jan. 3. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI jumped 177.56 points, or 1.78 percent, to 10,145.71. It is the highest level for the Dow since the second week of January. All market gauges pushed up through initial resistance levels, the point where sellers are likely to emerge, in a bullish sign for the market. The Dow blew through resistance at 10,050, the Nasdaq powered past 1,755 and the S&P ended above the 1,100 resistance level. The levels are key elements of technical analysis, which studies prices, volume and charts to ascertain the market's trend. "A close over those levels should create the potential for a further move to test the recovery highs around 10,300 on the DJI (Dow), and resistance levels around 1,130 on the S&P and 1,850 to 1,875 on Nasdaq," said Richard Dickson, technical analyst at Hilliard Lyons. Trading was heavy, with more than 1.66 billion shares traded on the Nasdaq and about 1.3 billion changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange. About 19 stocks rose for every 16 that fell on the Nasdaq, while 19 gained for every 11 that fell on the NYSE. Investors said the market's concern about corporate accounting is subsiding. Once it fades, "the focus will be on economic data, and the data continues to suggest we are in recovery and the recession is behind us," said Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at Global Partners Securities Inc. Indeed, the latest economic numbers showed sales of U.S. existing homes soared by a record 16.2 percent in January to a pace of 6.04 million units, due to mild weather and rebounding consumer confidence. January's pace out-ran the forecasts of analysts polled by Reuters, who predicted a pace of 5.25 million units. "The housing market continues to stay strong despite the weak jobs market and that's really good news," Cardillo said. General Motors bolted up $2.37 to $55.48, or almost 4.5 percent, after the automaker raised its estimates for first-quarter and full-year earnings and production schedules, citing better-than-expected sales in the United States. GM also said there were signs the U.S. economy is recovering from a recession. "The fact that General Motors is giving a more positive outlook is also very positive for the market," Cardillo said. Investors will be on the lookout for figures measuring the strength of fourth-quarter Gross Domestic Product, to signal whether the economy has truly turned the corner. Qualcomm rose $3.21 to $35.91. The wireless technology vendor reported better-than-expected demand for its cell-phone chips, easing jitters about the company and the industry's health. Luxury cooking supplies retailer Williams-Sonoma, up $1.06 at $45.15, boosted its fiscal 2001 earnings outlook, citing cost controls and products that appealed to consumers eager to spend money on their living space. Lowe's Cos. LOW.N, the No. 2 home improvement retailer behind Home Depot Inc. HD.N, reported a jump in quarterly profit, as low mortgage rates and mild winter weather spurred sales. The company also said fiscal 2002 earnings would top current estimates. Lowe's shares rose $1.44 to $47.49. Home Depot, a Dow stock, added $1.07 to $52.07. "We've had good economic numbers, but good company reports had been missing," said Richard Sichel, chief investment officer for Philadelphia Trust Co., which oversees $600 million. "This is a change in the right direction." Sun Microsystems Inc. SUNW.O added 80 cents to $8.87. Banc of America Securities raised its investment rating on the network computing giant to "buy" from "market perform," saying the stock's recent pullback creates an attractive buying opportunity. Tyco International Ltd TYC.N rose $2 to $29.50. The beleaguered conglomerate said a federal court dismissed shareholder claims brought in 1999 and 2000 that the company inflated profits through accounting maneuvers. The Morgan Stanley cyclical index .CYC, which tracks companies that prosper in tandem with good economic times, such as transportation firms, climbed 2.5 percent to 560.17, a six-month high. Cyclical stock Caterpillar Inc. CAT.N, which makes tractors and building equipment, advanced $3.38 to $56.06, boosting the Dow average. (c) Copyright Reuters 2001. All rights reserved.
