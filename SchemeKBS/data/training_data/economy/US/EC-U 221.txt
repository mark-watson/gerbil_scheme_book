
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries were mildly mixed on Thursday, with a rise in blue-chip stocks putting pressure on the market, while government securities received a boost from data showing the recovering labor market suffering a small setback. 

"There hasn't been much in the way of movement in the markets today, where we are essentially unchanged," said Kevin Flanagan, fixed income strategist at Morgan Stanley, who added the economic data on jobless claims had not done much to sway the market. 

"Unless you see something dramatic in the equity arena, I think we are going to hold to some pretty tight ranges," he said. 

Treasuries opened the session slightly lower, following rallies in overseas stock markets. 

In Tokyo, the Nikkei share average .N225 ended 4.69 percent higher Thursday, the biggest percentage gain since March 26, 2001, mainly on short-covering on a firmer Wall Street and renewed hopes for the government's anti-deflation measures. 

U.S. Treasuries trimmed early losses on news that jobless claims rose to 383,000 for the week ended Feb. 16, up from 373,00 the week before, and above a Wall Street forecast for new claims of 373,000. 

Economists said the data indicated the U.S. labor market was stabilizing but still splashed a bit of cold water on hopes for a quick economic rebound. 

"The labor market appears to be stabilizing but signs are still tentative and the consumer is still at risk," said Lehman Brothers economist Drew Matus. 

Jobless claims have fallen sharply from peaks of more than 500,000 after the Sept. 11 attacks. They have remained below the 400,000 mark -- a level above which is generally accepted as a signal the unemployment rate will rise -- for the past six weeks. 

Market players were waiting for further clues on the economy when the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia releases its February index of business conditions -- a gauge of manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region -- at noon EST (1700 GMT). 

Economists expected it to show the second straight month of growth after a deep slump that lasted more than a year. Analysts forecast on average a reading of 13.0, compared with 14.7 the prior month. 

They added the data are not likely to change the market's view that the Fed will keep interest rates low until at least mid-year. But analysts said they could pressure prices in the short-term, especially if the data come on the high end of expectations 

At 10:35 a.m. EST (1535 GMT), two-year Treasury notes US2YT=RR were off 1/32 at 100-2/32 to yield 2.97 percent and five-year notes US5YT=RR were up 2/32 at 97-1/32, yielding 4.20 percent. 

Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR were up 1/32 at 99-29/32, yielding 4.89 percent, and 30-year bonds US30YT=RR shed 2/32 to 99-22/32 to yield 5.39 percent. 

March 10-year futures TYH2 were unchanged at 107 even. 

Technology stocks slipped at the open on Thursday after an investment firm's bearish outlook for No. 1 semiconductor maker Intel Corp. INTC.O, but blue chips were higher, building on a rally a day earlier. 

The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 0.3 percent while the technology-laced Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC dropped 1.01 percent. 

Traders said there would be some pressure on shorter-dated securities over the next week as new two-year notes are sold next Wednesday. 

The note sale matches the record amount in January. That auction met with tepid demand, which helped tip a fall in Treasuries across the board. 

"We are going to have supply in the short end. They didn't go well last month, but they will probably go a little better because they are set up a little more for them," said Vincent Verterano, head of governments trading at Nomura Securities International in New York. 
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Technology stocks were lower in early-morning trading on Thursday after an investment firm's bearish outlook for No. 1 semiconductor maker Intel Corp. INTC.O sent a chill through Wall Street, but retailing and drug stocks held higher ground and boosted blue chips. 

"There are some horrible things happening in tech," said Robert S. Robbins, chief investment strategist for SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, "There was a negative comment out on Intel and it's a bellwether (stock). There's a good section of blue chips that are doing well, but tech is not the place to be." 

The technology-laced Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC dropped 9.85 points, or 0.55 percent, to 1,765.72, while the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 17.52 points, or 0.18 percent, at 9,958.65. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX lost 1.84 points, or 0.17 percent, to 1,096.14. 

Intel shares fell to $30.49 from $31.44. Brokerage firm Banc of America Securities trimmed earnings estimates for the world's largest computer chip marker, citing a possibly increasing supply of chips. 

In the latest economic news, leading indicators, a conglomerate of economic data points for January, rose 0.6, slighter higher than the 0.5 percent gain expected by economists surveyed by Reuters. 

A merger announcement captured investor interest. Legato Systems Inc. LGTO.O said it planned to buy OTG Software Inc. OTGS.O for $403 million in a cash-and-stock deal that will expand its data management offerings. 

The deal values OTG at $11.13 per share. Legato shares fell $1.91 to $10.63, while OTG advanced 45 cents to $9.65. 

Synopsys Inc. SNPS.O , a maker of electronic design automation tools, tumbled $2.49 to $47.55 after saying it expects second-quarter earnings to be at or below Wall Street estimates. 

Blue-chip stocks soared on Wednesday, with the Dow climbing 2 percent -- its biggest gain in 11 weeks -- as investors snapped up battered shares after days of selling fueled by concerns over loose accounting practices and mounting corporate debt. 

The recovering U.S. labor market suffered a moderate setback in the week ended Feb. 16. 

First-time jobless claims -- a guide to the job market and the pace of layoffs -- rose to 383,000, above a Wall Street forecast for new claims of 373,000, the Labor Department said. Still, a spokesman for the department said data released after a Monday holiday -- Presidents Day -- is subject to a larger than typical revision the following week. 

A more reliable barometer of employment market trends, the closely watched four-week moving average which irons out week-to-week volatility, rose for the first time in five weeks to 381,750 in the Feb. 16 week, up from 376,000 the prior week and the highest since 386,000 in the Jan. 26 week.
