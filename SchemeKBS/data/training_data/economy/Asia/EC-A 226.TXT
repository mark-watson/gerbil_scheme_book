TOKYO, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Tokyo stocks ended softer on Monday as investors cashed in profits on recent gainers such as Sony Corp 6758.T, but optimism over a government anti-deflation package due this week kept the broader market relatively firm. Sony, the world's largest audio-visual electronics maker, fell 1.12 percent to 6,200 yen, having climbed earlier to a one-and-a-half month high. The benchmark Nikkei average .N225 lost 0.58 percent or 60.31 points to 10,296.47, while the broader TOPIX index .TOPX gave up 0.21 percent or 2.07 points to 987.12. The Nikkei had jumped 5.3 percent over the past two sessions, boosted in part by speculation the anti-deflation package would include a more aggressive stance by the government on the use of public funds for troubled lenders. "I think the market consensus is that if they are going to eventually have to act (on the use of public funds), then they should step up to the plate now," said Shuichi Hida, a portfolio manager at Sanyo Investment Trust, which oversees 98 billion yen ($730.8 million) of investment trusts. "I seriously doubt it will happen this week. But there's a chance the government has still got something bold up its sleeve, making it difficult right now to sell." Mizuho Holdings Inc 8305.T, the world's largest bank by assets, rose 3.04 percent to 237,000 yen, leading a modest advance by all four of Japan's mega-banks. Activity was limited, with 709.37 million shares changing hands on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from Friday's 742.37 million. Decliners edged out gainers 677 to 658. PACKAGE HOPES The government's Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy is due to announce a package on Wednesday aimed at halting three years of deflation and speeding up the disposal of banks' bad loans. The package may include rule changes that would enable a state-backed entity called the Resolution and Collection Corp (RCC) to buy more bad loans from banks. Sanyo's Hida said he hoped the package would also include cuts in the capital gains tax and other tax-relief measures designed to revive the struggling corporate sector. Alexander Kinmont, equity strategist at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney, said he expected nothing of substance from the package. "To do anything bold they would have to admit they were entirely wrong," he said, referring to earlier injections of taxpayer money into banks totalling 10.5 trillion yen since 1998. Without decisive measures on banks, the Bank of Japan may be reluctant to further ease its ultra-loose monetary policy when its policy board meets on Thursday. Casio Computer Co Ltd 6952.T tumbled 4.17 percent to 482 yen. The manufacturer of digital watches and calculators late on Friday raised its group net loss forecast for the year to March, and Moody's Investors Service followed on Monday by placing its debt rating under review for possible downgrade. DAIEI PLUNGES, BRIDGESTONE FIRMS Daiei Inc 8263.T plunged 18.64 percent to 96 yen on news the troubled retail giant will finalise a three-year revival plan on Wednesday that includes a capital reduction of 99 percent of its common stock, greater than the 50 percent ratio in a previously unveiled plan. Debt-strapped builder Daikyo Inc 8840.T soared 11.69 percent to 86 yen after the Nihon Keizai Shimbun business daily said on Saturday that UFJ Bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Asahi Bank would consider giving more than 300 billion yen in aid to help the builder revive. Another winner was Bridgestone Corp 5108.T, which jumped 5.81 percent to 1,640 after the tyremaker said late on Friday its troubles related to tyres made by its Firestone unit were over and that it was on track to more than triple earnings in 2002. Takara Co Ltd 7969.T also rose, ending 2.67 percent higher at 847 yen. Japan's third-largest toymaker told Reuters in an interview on Monday it expected to post a record group net profit for 2001/02, slightly exceeding its earlier target of 5.2 billion yen ($38.78 million). The success of its popular spinning-top-like "Bey Blade" and "E-kara" home karaoke system helped Takara's profit for the six months through September rise more than 10 times year-on-year.
