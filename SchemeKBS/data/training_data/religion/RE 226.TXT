"His progressive stand on a range of social and sexual issues, and his repeated calls for greater Church democracy, made him the unchallenged champion of Roman Catholic liberalism since he became a Cardinal nearly 20 years ago," the Times explained.Vatican insiders believe that Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi, 67, the Archbishop of Genoa, is the "new standard-bearer of the liberals," with the leading conservative contenders to include Cardinal Camillo Ruini, 70, Vicar of Rome and head of the Italian Bishops' Conference, who "shares the Pope's views on doctrine and is constantly at his side."  Cardinal Martini is still eligible to vote for the next Pope, and technically could still be elected as Pope himself.Falwell: 'God Even Loves the Taliban'February 12, 2002A digest of news articles from around the worldCrosswalk.com News Channel - The Rev. Jerry Falwell told about 800 people gathered at the Berean Baptist Church in suburban West Palm Beach, Fla., on Feb. 6, "You know, God even loves the Taliban and today, if we're going to impress God, we've got to get the Gospel out to everyone."  He added the rebuke that "If the church had been awake and performing that duty...we wouldn't be in the mess we're in today," reported the South Florida Sun-Sentinel.Falwell also encouraged parents to enroll their children in the Christian school he founded in Lynchburg, Va., ...to "protect them from a godless university where the professors don't believe in the Bible."A gay rights protester/activist, Bob Kunst of Miami Beach, was outside the church building, holding a sign calling Falwell the leader of "America's Taliban."  Falwell had stopped to talk to him before going inside, and related to the crowd, "I'd love to see old Bob walk in here...I'd tell him that 'God loves you...and he'll save you from a perverted lifestyle.'"Missionary Describes Her Life-Changing Service in HondurasFebruary 13, 2002A digest of news articles from around the worldCrosswalk.com News Channel - Suzanne Westover said her earliest months in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, were quite difficult because she lived in an unsafe area and was restricted as to where she could go. But through that, she learned a "new dependence in that I had never fully depended on God before...He was with me and gave me peace for the first time in my life," as reported by the Latin American Mission (LAM) News Service.For six months as a short-term missionary with LAM's Spearhead program, Westover taught English at a Christian university, helped medical groups and worked on other projects. She is currently finishing up her university studies in Chicago and plans to return to Honduras for an additional year. "I'm going back so different in a lot of ways...God has definitely changed a lot of things in me. I'm not sure whether God is calling me to full-missionary service," she said.   She explained that she feels that through her studies and service, she is preparing to work "right here in the U.S., but that might change."Crosswalk.com News Channel - Building a church from the ground up can take a long time and a lot of money. "For some, this is how a church is 'founded, planted or begun,'" said the Rev. Patrick Propster, 44, to the youth in his ministry.  He added that "Christ is our foundation" and "It's amazing how you can take a warehouse and turn it into a place of prayer and worship...God doesn't care where you meet."The Nevada Appeal reported the 180-member congregation moved into the 25,000-square-foot warehouse, and went over a lease/option-to-buy deal with the owner. The Carson City Building Department and staff were "all so helpful" in figuring out how to meet safety and building codes...The church, to start with, would utilize only about 7,000 square feet."It's amazing how many artists, construction workers and others surfaced when we needed them," Propster said.  He asked God what His plans were for Propster:  "Continue pastoring in Las Vegas or help the struggling Carson City Christian Fellowship?...(it was then) I knew I was here to make it (the church) flourish."Hare Krishna Congregations Being Sued, May Go BankruptFebruary 13, 2002A digest of news articles from around the worldCrosswalk.com News Channel - After being named in a $400 million lawsuit alleging sexual and emotional abuse of boarding school students, Hare Krishna congregations plan to file for bankruptcy, a spokesman said on Feb. 6, according to World News and an AP story. The spokesman for the International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), Anuttama Dasa, said, "But we don't believe that innocent members and congregations should be held accountable for the deviant behavior of individual acts committed 20 or 30 years ago."  The group hopes to settle a Texas lawsuit, including 94 plaintiffs, through the setting up of a fund to compensate children who may have been victimized in the Hare Krishna boarding schools during the 1970s and 1980s.   Windle Turley, the Dallas attorney who filed the lawsuit, advised that the abuse started in 1972 in Dallas, and continued in six other U.S. Hare Krishna schools, and two in India. A dozen schools operated in North America by the late 1970s, but all have since closed.  About a dozen congregations will start filing for Chapter 11 reorganization next week in California, Texas, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Washington, according to the ISKCON attorney.Bible Class Retained Despite Court's Ruling February 13, 2002A digest of news articles from around the worldCrosswalk.com News Channel - "On Friday, Feb. 8, a federal judge ordered Rhea County (Tennessee) to stop Bible classes, saying they violate the constitutional rights of two children whose parents anonymously challenged the program in a lawsuit," as reported in an AP story and the Picayune Item (TN).Before a decision came down, a reporter was permitted to sit in on a Thursday class. The school officials describe it as "teaching character and morality" and advised the Bible Education Ministry program has been "a fixture" in Rhea County's public elementary schools for about 51 years.Parents are not consulted about their children participating, but one fifth-grader - as noticed by the visiting reporter - received permission to "opt-out," as had been determined at the beginning of the school year. "I have her go to the library and she gets to read," said one teacher. Incidentally, "the child who did not participate is a Jehovah's Witness," she added.Field Goal Kicker: 'God Will Always Be There to Help You'February 13, 2002A digest of news articles from around the worldCrosswalk.com News Channel - It was a last-second Super Bowl XXXVI victory for the New England Patriots over the St. Louis Rams, 20-17, when Adam Vinatieri was sent in the game to accomplish a 48-yard field goal. However, his sudden "NFL stardom" did not follow an easy path, according to Vinatieri's testimony reported by Christian Sports Minute news.He had a successful football career in college, and even though it had been in a relatively small school, he aspired to a spot in the NFL, the report said. He was often discouraged, especially when he was "overlooked in the NFL draft" but he overcame the odds, telling himself that David had beat Goliath.In Europe, he kicked footballs for the World League's Amsterdam Admirals - it was then that the NFL "took notice" and signed Vinatieri to a free-agent contract with the Patriots. "You always have some ups and downs in your life," he said. "A lot of times you feel like you are on an island as a kicker...but if you know He'll always be there to help you, it will be all right."Bruce Wilkinson Leaving Walk Thru the BibleFebruary 15, 2002A digest of news articles from around the worldCrosswalk.com News Channel - The Board of Directors of Walk Thru the Bible announced Feb. 15 that Dr. Bruce Wilkinson is resigning from his position as president of the 25-year-old ministry.Wilkinson is leaving to pursue a broader mission through the medium of television and film, the Board said. Wilkinson and his family will be moving to California later this year.Wilkinson said, "Walk Thru the Bible will continue its bountiful history of innovative Bible teaching, and I will remain close to the Board and staff as we develop Bible teaching resources in the future.""We wish Bruce the best in his new ventures, and we look forward to another 25 years of outstanding ministry at Walk Thru the Bible. We will enjoy a continuing affiliation with Bruce, as he continues to produce high quality Bible-teaching materials. In addition to these materials, we have strong, able leaders at the organizational level, and we excitedly await what the future holds," said Paul Johnson, chairman of the Walk Thru the Bible board.Walk Thru the Bible, the world's largest Bible teaching seminar organization, hosted more than 2500 seminars in 2001 in America alone. Through its video curriculum, devotional publications, and seminars, Walk Thru the Bible provides Bible teaching tools to millions of individuals and organizations. In 2001, the international ministry reached more than one million people in over 50 nations.Underground Covert Church in North Korea is GrowingFebruary 25, 2002A digest of news articles from around the worldCrosswalk.com News Channel - In spite of the persecution of most religions in North Korea, a covert church is growing, and even includes members of the power structure, said Todd Nettleton, a spokesman for the Voice of the Martyrs (VoM) in talking with United Press International (UPI) on Feb. 21. "To our knowledge, its members are either old people who had already been Christians ... or the very young who have been converted as refugees in China."  Nettleton said that converts cross secretly from China back into North Korea to plant clandestine churches. "When converts are caught returning to North Korea from China, they are usually killed immediately," Nettleton said. "If they are caught by the Chinese and extradited to North Korea, they are incarcerated." In 1998 the government allowed three Christian churches to open in its capital, Pyongyang - two are Protestant, one is Catholic. European visitors to Pyongyang reported the Christian congregations were "clearly bogus."  They said they believed they were witnesses to "a rent-a-crowd obviously ordered into those churches to impress foreigners."  Russian Christian: Mafia Trying to Take Over ChurchFebruary 25, 2002A digest of news articles from around the worldCrosswalk.com News Channel - A Russian Christian, whose family has for generations been church leaders, told ASSIST News Service at the recent National Religious Broadcasters convention in Nashville, that he is "now facing the greatest threat of his life - from the Russian Mafia who are trying to take over his church." Dimitri Shatrov Jr. said he has already received many death threats from the Russian Mafia over the years in trying to take over the huge Good News Mission Church he is building.  It is in a prime location because "there is a subway station just 20 meters away.  People in Russia don't use cars like in America ... they use the subway." He explained that 300,000 people daily use that station, so it is a wonderful place for businesses, and the Mafia wants his building. He added that he had just received a message that his land and building had been taken over by the St. Petersburg city council to give it to the Mafia..." But I have my hope and trust in God ... We have been building this church for 10 years without money to do it -- it has been an act of faith."LPGA Golfer's 'Foremost Passion' is the Lord By Joni B. Hannigan Baptist Press News ServiceFebruary 22, 2002Crosswalk.com News Channel - Instead of packing golf clubs and tearing up the greens in mid- February, professional golfer Tracy Hanson packed her personal testimony and "Jesus pins" and headed to Salt Lake City for the Winter Olympics.Trading green grass for icy breezes and hordes of people -- a result of an unexpected tour rescheduling -- Hanson joined with other Action Ministries International volunteers in sharing the love of Christ with people from all over the world.Hanson, a member of the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) since 1995, turned professional in 1993 after playing collegiate golf at San Jose State University where she won 10 collegiate titles and was a member of the 1992 NCAA national championship team.In Salt Lake City, Hanson, who has previously shared her testimony through the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and through a story in "Chicken Soup for the Golfer's Soul," was able to join with the Action Ministries team to share her testimony in a more direct way."Most of the time I speak to groups of people as a professional athlete and share my testimony without a lot of one-on-one interaction," said Hanson, who said working with Action Ministries has given her the opportunity to go beyond routine. "I felt God saying, 'You're to go.'"Although Hanson grew up playing golf, she said her family withdrew from going to church as she entered high school."We just stopped going," said Hanson, who said sports, basketball and skiing became a priority although she lived in a "morally based" household."The concept of God was there," Hanson said, "but the daily fellowship with Jesus wasn't there."It wasn't until high school was over and she was a 17-year-old about to embark on a college career that God used the quiet of a long road trip to get Hanson's attention.Scared and lonely, Hanson drove her four-door blue Mazda from Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, where she lived with her parents on a nine-hole public golf course, to San Jose State University where she would ultimately become a four-time All-American. On the way Hanson began to think of her future and reflected on an inspiration book written for athletes."I was on my way from Idaho to California to go to school when God prompted me to ask Christ into my life," Hanson said, recounting that she waited another year and then finally got involved in Campus Crusade for Christ and Athletes in Action and developed a group of Christian friends.Growing spiritually all along, Hanson said it wasn't until the last five years as she suffered through a relationship break-up and faced the loss of her mother to cancer that she became closer to God and his will."God has really been doing a lot in my life in the last five years," Tracy said, eyes instantly filling with tears. "I finally found him in my heart and not just my head."Hanson lives in Ormond Beach, Fla., when she is not on tour. On tour, she makes do with living between airplanes and hotel rooms, which can be a lonely existence and difficult at times. Communicating by e-mail and phone with her family members and friends helps her to stay connected, and surrounding herself with "likeminded" people helps her stay focused.Hanson said living on the tour which runs from February through December is not necessarily the "fun and exciting" lifestyle many people associate with professional sports. She relies on a fellowship of other Christian women who meet regularly for Bible study and prayer and a consistent organized worship time that becomes church time each week."My biggest challenge is staying consistent in my spiritual life and in my physical skill as a golfer," Hanson said. "It takes a lot of patience and understanding that there are going to be the little valleys -- and some days are good and some days a little difficult."But God still loves me regardless of what I do or how I do it," Hanson said.Winning the Indonesian Open in 1994 was Hanson's crowning moment on the tour -- the one she still tries to repeat every week on the tour. Her silver winner's platter sits on the shelf in her condominium in Ormond Beach.Hanson begins this year's tour Feb. 28 at the LPGA Takefugi Classic at the Waikoloa Beach Resort in Big Island, Hawaii. But even the warm sands and crashing waves won't distract her from what's most important while she's there -- or anywhere else on the tour."Golf is something I do. It's not what drives me in my life," Hanson said. "At one time it was who I was and what I did, but I know that golf is something God has gifted me in and given me for a period of time, not only to make a living but to share my faith and love for him."A bigger dream on the horizon for Hanson is her desire to be married and have a family, at which time she plans to give up the tour altogether."My heart is to give up golf when God bring marriage or family to my life," Hanson said. "First and foremost, my passion is to the Lord and I think he's still revealing new passions to me every day."Congressman Wants Ten Commandments Posted in House & SenateBy Jeff JohnsonCNS Congressional Bureau ChiefFebruary 25, 2002A U.S. congressman has introduced a resolution to order the posting of the Ten Commandments in the U.S. House and Senate chambers. Rep. Brian Kerns (R-Ind.) says he introduced the "Ten Commandments Public Display Resolution of 2002" (H. Con. Res. 315) because Congress "should proudly display the Ten Commandments and recognize the contribution they have made to the United States."He says the biblical instructions have a significance that goes far beyond religion."The Ten Commandments are fundamental to the development of the basic legal principles of Western civilization and our nation," Kerns said. "They set forth a code of conduct that promotes respect for our system of laws and the good of society."Americans United for Separation of Church and State (AU) opposes the resolution."Should this be successful, it would raise serious legal questions and, in all likelihood, be unconstitutional," AU spokesman Steve Benen said, referring to the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which forbids Congress from establishing religion or limiting the free expression of religion. "The Supreme Court and federal courts have ruled that the Ten Commandments are, obviously a religious text, and the government cannot be in the business of promoting religious texts," Benen said. AU has previously filed lawsuits against public officials for displaying the Ten Commandments on public property."For the same reason that it is unconstitutional in a school, or courthouse, or other public building," Benen added, "it is equally as problematic for Congress to do the same thing."The group believes the proposal would potentially set a dangerous precedent, even though it has been submitted as a "Concurrent Resolution," rather than a bill, which would have the force of law if passed."I imagine that, in the event the House of Representatives votes to approve such a request that it would be taken seriously by the House Architect, and the Speaker, and other congressional leaders," Benen added. "I don't know what would happen as a result."Kerns introduced the resolution Feb. 6 with no co-sponsors. Benen sees that as a good sign."I'm hopeful that a strong majority of lawmakers would reject such an effort," he said. "Hopefully this resolution will go nowhere."Kerns is also a co-sponsor of the Public Statement of Religion Act (H.R.1273), which would allow courts to issue injunctions, but not award monetary damages or attorneys' fees, in lawsuits alleging violations of the "Establishment Clause" of the First Amendment. The bill is necessary, he says, to eliminate the "chilling effect on constitutionally protected expressions of religion" resulting from the threat of lawsuits."I do not believe that our Founding Fathers meant to remove all religious references from the public square as many in the liberal establishment would have us believe," Kerns argued. "Organizations like the ACLU are using the threat of costly lawsuits and activist courts to restrict religious statements. We must stand together and work to reverse this trend," he said. Benen was not familiar with the bill and could not, therefore, comment on it. A request to the American Civil Liberties Union for an interview regarding the two pieces of legislation received no response.
