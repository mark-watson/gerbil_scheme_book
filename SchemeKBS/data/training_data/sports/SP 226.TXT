French skating official rips 2nd gold  Gailhaguet also denies wrongactions by eitherjudge, federation	  French skating federation chief Didier Gailhaguet said Tuesday there was no evidence against Marie-Reine Le Gougne, the French judge at the center of the vote-rigging scandal.	 ASSOCIATED PRESSPARIS, Feb. 26 -  The president of the French skating federation called the decision to award a second Olympic gold medal to Canada in the pairs competition "total nonsense."  			DIDIER GAILHAGUET, RETURNING from the Winter Games in Salt Lake City, also insisted Tuesday that there was no wrongdoing on the part of either French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne or the French skating federation. 	¥ 	More on Olympics        "We were dirtied in a media affair without precedent," Gailhaguet said.       Le Gougne sparked one of the biggest controversies in Olympic skating history this month when she cast a crucial vote in favor of Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze over Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier. The Russians won 5-4 despite an obvious technical error.       Le Gougne at first said she'd been pressured into voting for the Russians by Gailhaguet - apparently in a vote-swapping deal to assure a victory in ice dancing for the French couple, Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat. But then she recanted that story and said she had voted honestly and with her conscience.       Canadian judge Benoit Lavoie was quoted in Tuesday's editions of Le Journal de Montreal as saying that Le Gougne "confessed to not having had a choice in favoring the Russian couple" for the gold medal.       Lavoie added that Le Gougne also "implicated Didier Gailhaguet as the source of this pressure."       Lavoie was scheduled to hold a news conference Tuesday in Quebec City.       "It's time to set the record straight," Lavoie said. "I don't know what the other judges did, but I believe I started the official denunciation of what was questionable behavior. When Le Gougne contradicted herself, I said to myself that there must be an official request to support the report of American referee Ron Pfenning."       The International Olympic Committee suspended Le Gougne indefinitely and awarded a gold medal to the Canadian pair. Gailhaguet criticized those actions and said he thinks Le Gougne voted for the Russians simply because she believed they deserved to win.       "To accuse people, you need evidence," he said. "In no case did we cheat."       "It was total nonsense to award two gold medals," Gailhaguet added. 	G	S	B	TOTGER	12	16	7	35USA	10	13	11	34NOR	11	7	6	24CAN	6	3	8	17AUT	2	4	10	16RUS	6	6	4	16After retracting her earlier story, Le Gougne has suggested that she was pressured by senior skating officials in Canada and that it was Sally Stapleford, chairwoman of the International Skating Union's powerful technical committee, who suggested she identify the French federation as the culprit.       Stapleford was born and raised in Britain and lives in London, but also holds a Canadian passport.       The Canadian Olympic Association has dismissed any claims of Canadian pressure.       "I don't know if she did that, I wasn't there," Gailhaguet said Tuesday. "But if she did, she should immediately resign." 			       He also said the French skating federation has made proposals to reform the judging system.       "That's what we wanted, but we have systematically been rebuffed by the Anglo-Saxon countries," he said. "So who is profiting from the crime?"       The ISU will meet in April to make a final decision about the accusations. The ISU Council received a report from its investigators.       Le Gougne and Gailhaguet will have a chance to defend themselves at the meeting in April. No date has been set.Whether Michael Jordan plays through the pain in his right knee or elects to go on the injured list, he should consider cutting back his playing time, according to NBCSports.com's Matt Guokas.	  	  	February 25 -  Only Michael Jordan knows for sure if his 39-year-old legs are leading him back into retirement. But right now, I think his psyche is being tormented as much, if not more, than his ailing right knee. He sees a playoff spot slipping away yet realizes he is unable to consistently play at the level needed to save it. Simply put, now that his team needs him the most, he has the least to give. It's a painful paradox for the six-time NBA champ.	    			MICHAEL STILL PRIDES himself on having the league's strongest constitution; able to withstand all the rigors and demands of the regular season while still having the strength to carry his team through the playoffs. Although he did that regularly in Chicago, he just can't sustain the same level in Washington because (1) he's older and (2) he's not surrounded by top-notch talent.       TO PLAY OR NOT TO PLAY       Heading into this season I didn't see anything magical about Jordan trying to play every game. Other than the fact that the Wizards, especially on the road, could pack an arena with him in the lineup, it didn't make any sense. That's not hindsight; that's reality. He was nearly 39 and retired for three years. 	¥ 	More on the NBA        Even after Washington bounced back from a 2-9 start to win nine straight games, I thought it would've been a good idea for Jordan to try to pace himself to sustain his play for the course of the entire season. But that's not Michael's nature; he's going to go full blast everyday.       So now with his team one game below .500 and in the midst of a five-game losing streak, Jordan is thinking about giving the chronic pain in his right knee a rest on the injured list, which would sideline him for a minimum of five games. While this might have been a major concession earlier in his career, I think the decision would be far less taxing for him to make today. If he considers that there is still one-third of the season remaining and the Wizards have to make another West Coast trip as well as seven sets of back-to-back games to play, Michael might feel he could both heal the knee and recharge the batteries with the five-game break. If I were Michael, however, I'd just take it day-to-day and see how he feels. Whether it's five, ten or twenty games, he should let his body tell him what to do.		       Michael has proven once again that he can come back and be one of the top players in the league. But what is it really doing for the future of the Washington Wizards? Certainly he has helped the franchise generate a lot of revenue while giving the team a one-year reprieve from its disastrous past. But we won't know how much Jordan actually helped this core of Wizard players until after he's gone. One need only look to Scottie Pippen to see how experiencing success with Jordan doesn't necessarily carry with it a residual effect. While not to diminish Pippen's talents, he never had the impact of a six-time champion on his teams in Houston or Portland.       How much have the Wizards really developed? Richard Hamilton was a good player last year who improved this season. Although he is probably a little better when he's on the floor with Michael, will it be a career-altering experience for him once Jordan leaves? I don't think so because nobody plays like Michael.        Besides the play of Hamilton and rookie Brendan Haywood, Kwame Brown hasn't developed that much, Courtney Alexander doesn't look to have a long-term future in Washington, and, while the Wizards like the play of Popeye Jones, Hubert Davis and Chris Whitney, where are they going with older role players who do a nice job? The Wizards still need two more quality players and finding them in the draft will be tough since their draft status will be hurt by the number of games they've won.        MJ'S PAST OUTSHINES WIZARDS' FUTURE       If we've learned one thing over the years, it's to never doubt Michael Jordan. But when he begins to question whether his body is as able as his mind to finish a season that's only two-thirds complete, and then he starts to mention the "R-word" once again, it has to be cause for pause in the Wizards' front office. Although this year has been a nice financial windfall for the organization-which is never bad-what has it really done for the long-term future of the franchise? Canada wins hockey gold 02/25/2002 By MIKE HEIKA / The Dallas Morning News WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah - Everyone was looking for a reason to give the United States a gold medal in the Olympic men's hockey tournament, from tracing the history of the "Miracle on Ice" in 1980 to recounting Team USA's 21-0-3 Olympic streak on home ice that dates to 1932. The only problem is they forgot that Canada has its own kind of mojo.  Erich Schlegel / DMN USA's Tony Amonte (right) celebrates scoring a goal. It was Feb. 24, 1952, when Canada last won an Olympic gold medal in men's hockey. On their golden anniversary, the Canadians took the gold once again, defeating the United States, 5-2, before a crowd of 8,599 at the E Center. "I think we had a little destiny on our side," Team Canada forward Theo Fleury said. Canada had in net Olympic legacy Martin Brodeur. His dad, Denis, was goalie for the 1956 Canadian Olympic Team. What's more, Team Canada executive director Wayne Gretzky revealed after the game that NHL rink experts buried a Canadian one dollar coin (nicknamed a Loonie) in the ice while getting it ready for the tournament. Gretzky held up the coin at the news conference. But talk of destiny had to be buffeted by the fact that what Canada did on the ice had much more influence than what lay below the ice. "It was a good hockey game," Team USA defenseman Brian Leetch said. "They just beat us." Canada controlled just about every aspect of the game and was able to wear down the Americans, who said they were tired after a tough semifinal Friday with Russia. Canada played a perfect North American game in which it used the trap, pushed the puck into the offensive zone, had defensemen join the play and kept control of its gap. While the U.S. team tried to generate chances with its east-west style, Canada bullied its way to a north-south game. "The way we played, it was our game totally," said Ken Hitchcock, former Stars coach and an assistant for Team Canada. "Everything we believe in, we put it on the ice, and we were very successful. The first two periods was about as well as any team could play the game of hockey. We made literally no mistakes; you're talking about perfection."  Erich Schlegel / DMN The Stars' Joe Nieuwendyk of Team Canada celebrates his gold medal with daughter Tyra, 10 months. Canada played its deep game, relying on its size advantage, and hemmed the U.S. team in. It also did a great job of shutting down the U.S. power play, including a key man advantage with 6:18 left in the game with the score 3-2 in Canada's favor. Team USA center Mike Modano said he saw a lot of similarities in the way Team Canada ran its penalty kill, a direct compliment to Hitchcock. "He had a lot of influence on a lot of things they did," Modano said. "They killed penalties the same way [the Stars] did, and they did a lot of things that he did with us." Hitchcock said knowing how Modano plays was a key to shutting down Team USA's top line. "Modano, to me, is the best two-way player in the world, and we just felt we had to play really competitive people against him the whole time," Hitchcock said. "That's the disadvantage of a player playing for a coach for a long time." In the end, Canada did everything right. It earned a gold medal the country had been seeking for years. It also earned back the right to call itself the greatest hockey nation in the world, at least for four more years. "We wanted to play good old Canadian hockey," said defenseman Scott Niedermayer, proud not only to win, but win in a manner that says something about his country. "This is pretty special. I'm sure they're partying in Canada right now." ------------------------------------------------------------------------Online at: http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/topstories/stories/0225olymenhocklede.d6456.html
