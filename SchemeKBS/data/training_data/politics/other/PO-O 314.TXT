Mugabe, the only leader Zimbabwe has known in 22 years of independence, faced his first real challenge in Tsvangirai, a former labor organizer.But independent observers questioned the validity of the vote, saying it was tainted by violence, intimidation, confusion and the disenfranchisement of thousands of voters in the opposition stronghold of Harare."The presidential elections failed to meet key, broadly accepted criteria for elections," said Kare Vollan, head of the 25-member Norwegian Observer mission.He said the mission, the largest European delegation, found flaws with every step of the electoral process from voter registration and campaigning to the actual vote.	 News onazcentral.com• Breaking News• News From Home• AP WireEmail newslettersSign up to receive breaking news alerts, delivered to your inbox free whenever big news happens.   Republic Front Page | Valley & State | SportsArizona Living | Business | Opinions Subscribe to The Republic Terms of Service Help Center | About us Copyright 2002, The Arizona Republic.
