Miami HeraldMarch 03, 2002 MIAMI - For sale: Color map of Cuba, circa 1962. In good condition, except for some handwritten notes.Price: $750,000.See, the notes reportedly were written by then-President Kennedy on Oct. 16, 1962, when he was told there were Soviet missiles on the communist-ruled island.Nine X's mark the spots where the missiles were thought to be: near Bahia Honda and Guanajay, both west of Havana. The words "missile sites" are underlined twice and surrounded by arrows. On the back, in the same black ink, Kennedy doodled some words, apparently from his discussion that day with his top advisers: "NATO," "Cuba," "Reconnaissance," and "hoping to intercept."The map is being sold by a historic memorabilia dealer in Washingtonville, N.Y. And he thinks he can find a buyer in Miami, someone who will treasure it, said the dealer, Gary Zimet."I'm sure with the large Cuban community, this would have especially great interest," he said. "It should go to a good home, someone who'll appreciate and take care of it."Zimet is selling the map for the second time."I sold it to a client about three years ago and am now selling it on his behalf. He's looking to divest himself of some of his fine-arts holdings," said Zimet, president of momentsintime.com, which sells autographs, letters, manuscripts, signed photographs and other historic documents.Items on Zimet's Web site include a book of poems reportedly written by The Doors frontman Jim Morrison about a month before his death ($500,000) and a check signed by mobster Meyer Lansky on July 1, 1938, payable to a Dr. Tishler for $35.50 ($850).Last year, Zimet sold the album signed by John Lennon to Mark Chapman five hours before Chapman shot him dead in 1980. It fetched $460,000.But the map is his big-ticket item."In all modesty, it's about the best damn thing I've ever sold," he said. He said his client asked him not to divulge how much it cost three years ago."I can't overstress the importance of the piece. It's unarguably the best Kennedy autograph that has ever been for sale," said Zimet, who gets a 15 percent "buyer's premium."Zimet acknowledges that the piece probably belongs in a museum, such as the Florida International Museum in St. Petersburg, home of the world's largest private collection of John F. Kennedy artifacts. Exhibits feature such objects as a rocking chair used by Kennedy in the Oval Office, a pen Kennedy used to sign the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and the slain president's prescription sunglasses.In fact, the man who amassed the museum collection, much of which was bequeathed to him by Evelyn Lincoln, Kennedy's personal secretary, was Robert White, a Kennedy memorabilia collector and the one who originally had the map. He sold it to a collector, who sold it to Zimet.Zimet said the map, which he says White told him was prepared by the CIA, was probably given to Lincoln by Kennedy. "In addition to being his secretary, she was his confidante, and he gave her many, many artifacts, highly important ones over the years."But it does come with a documentation letter from White, who said he got confirmation from a former CIA topographer who said it was definitely prepared by the agency. He believes Zimet's map is the same one he had, and he now rues the day he got rid of it."I would have rather kept it with the Cuban Missile Crisis material I collect," White said. He said it would have gone nicely with a magnifying glass Kennedy reportedly used to check out the fine print. But it was rather large and he didn't have a place for it."At that time, I didn't have any prospect of a museum."PHOENIX: 61 More Weather	          Drought takes a firm grip on much of the country Drought has engulfed nearly a third of the nation, threatening to have some places this summer facing what could be their worst water shortages in years."This is a sleeping giant," said Mark Svoboda of the National Drought Mitigation Center in Lincoln, Neb. New York and Baltimore are pumping water from temporary supplies usually avoided for their less desirable color or taste. Thousands of shallow wells in New Hampshire and Georgia have run dry. In Kansas, some ranchers are hauling in water or selling cattle.Yet a much stiffer test will come this summer when farmers water crops, homeowners douse lawns and gardens, and high temperatures evaporate more water more quickly. Without a rainy spring, some places in the East may face a summer of water problems that rival record droughts of the 1960s, according to Harry Lins, a drought specialist at the U.S. Geological Survey.Montana, in its fourth year of drought, was told last week that it is on course for a return to the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s. Rivers and reservoirs hold less water than normal, mountain snowpack is lagging, and soil is being blown away on strong winter winds, according to reports given the state Drought Advisory Committee.In typically dry Southern California, the recent feeble wet season is apt to harden into full-blown drought, government and private forecasters said. Bernie Rayno, a forecaster at the private AccuWeather service in State College, Pa., is more worried about that region than the East."They're missing their window of opportunity," he said. "Once you get past that, you're not going to get rain there."In the past six months, Los Angeles has received a bit more than a third of its usual 11 inches of rain.Overall, drought has spread to about 30 percent of the country, said Richard Tinker at the Climate Prediction Center of the National Weather Service. That is an unusually broad reach but still far short of the Dust Bowl in most places. In those years, up to 70 percent of the country was parched, and dust clouds sometimes blotted out the sun for days at a time.Drought conditions run in two vast Eastern and Western strips, each hundreds of miles across, from Maine to Georgia and Montana to Texas, according to a federal-academic partnership that puts together the U.S. Drought Monitor map.Forecasters said it's especially difficult to make long-range forecasts for the Northeast. But they hope that typical spring rain will relieve some of that region's drought conditions, which took hold only in the fall. Drought has lingered elsewhere, like Texas and Georgia, for up to six years.There is no single accepted definition of drought. One popular standard defines it as 70 percent of normal rain or snow for three months straight.Several factors have combined to parch so much area, drought experts said. La Ni–a, a cooling of Pacific Ocean surface water, is blamed for recent warm, dry winters in the Southeast and warm, dry summers in the northern Rocky Mountain states.A northern track taken by the jet stream has steered this winter's storms toward the Pacific Northwest and Midwest. High pressure in the East has also locked out storms.Finally, one of the warmest winters on record in some places on the East Coast is letting water soak into soft ground, instead of running off to replenish surface supplies.Communities along the coast have issued drought watches and warnings. Many have appealed for voluntary cuts in water use.Some governments have taken their own steps. Connecticut environmental officials said Wednesday that they were suspending the annual opening of dams for the first time since 1981. The water release is meant to scour riverbeds to improve fish habitats.With only about half of the normal 23 inches of precipitation over the past six months, New York City's reservoirs have sunk to 48 percent of capacity. Water managers have doubled the share used from the New Croton Reservoir, actually an older system, to 20 percent, though people sometimes complain of its darker color and unpleasant smell. Officials say mandatory reductions in water use could be imposed within a month.In addition, two common diarrhea-causing microorganisms have been detected in area reservoirs. Chlorinated water is deemed safe for the general population, but doctors were warned Feb. 14 to advise New York City area residents with weak immune systems to boil water.Baltimore reservoirs are lower than ever for this time of year. The Prettyboy, one of three city reservoirs, is at one-third of capacity."Prettyboy is starting to look like the Grand Canyon out there, with all these cracks in the mud," said Kurt Kocher, a spokesman for the city Public Works Department.
