Ministers and their representatives said on Saturday that action was urgently needed to curb greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, but advanced and developing countries are split on how to share the burden.

The three-day meeting of the Group of Eight and rapidly growing economies such as China and India comes as poor countries balk at global targets to cut emissions, demanding that rich nations cut their own and pay for costly clean energy projects.

Brazil's top delegate said it was vital for developed countries to pass on know-how and help fund research for new technologies.

"Certainly the private sector has an important role to play ... but we think that states also and governments have a role to play in helping developing countries to develop technology," Ana Maria Fernandes told the meeting.

The United States, in talks with Japan, called for a global fund for clean technology research, while Tokyo said the G8 must show initiative so poorer countries can do their part in fighting climate change, blamed for droughts, rising seas and more intense storms.

"We need to send a message that we will make it easier for emerging countries to act, with financial mechanisms and technological cooperation," Japanese Environment Minister Ichiro Kamoshita told reporters.
