# Wikidata API Using SPARQL Queries

Wikidata is a free, collaborative, and multilingual knowledge base that functions as the central structured data repository for the Wikimedia ecosystem, including projects like Wikipedia, Wikivoyage, and Wiktionary. Launched in 2012, its mission is to create a common source of open data that can be used by anyone, anywhere. Unlike Wikipedia, which contains prose articles, Wikidata stores information in a machine-readable format structured around items (representing any concept or object), which are described by properties (like "population" or "author") and corresponding values. For example, the item for "Earth" has a property "instance of" with the value "planet". This structured approach allows for data consistency across hundreds of language editions of Wikipedia and enables powerful, complex queries through its SPARQL endpoint. By providing a centralized, queryable, and interlinked database of facts, Wikidata not only supports Wikimedia projects but also serves as a crucial resource for researchers, developers, and applications worldwide that require reliable and openly licensed structured information.
