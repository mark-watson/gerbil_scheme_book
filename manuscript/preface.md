# Preface

I have used Lisp languages since the late 1970s, Common Lisp and Clojure professionally, and other Lisp languages, mostly various Scheme implementations for writing utilities, network programming, and various AI experiments. This book is specifically about effectively using Gerbil Scheme for writing software to solve practical problems.

Both the source code examples and the manuscript files for this book are maintained in a single GitHub repository: [https://github.com/mark-watson/gerbil_scheme_book](https://github.com/mark-watson/gerbil_scheme_book). I recommend that you keep a local copy:

    git clone https://github.com/mark-watson/gerbil_scheme_book.git
    
The code is licensed using the "business friendly" LGPL license and the manuscript files under a Creative Commons Share and Share Alike, No Commercial Reuse license. It is my hope, dear reader, that you get value from this material and reuse it in your own projects.
