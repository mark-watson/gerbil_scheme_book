# Code for Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Writing code for Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves applying computational techniques to analyze, understand, and generate human language, bridging the gap between human communication and computer interpretation. The field heavily relies on programming, predominantly using languages like Python due to its extensive ecosystem of specialized libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), spaCy, and Hugging Face's transformers. These tools provide the building blocks for implementing a wide array of NLP tasks, from foundational steps like tokenization (splitting text into words or sentences) and part-of-speech tagging to more complex applications like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (identifying people and places), machine translation, and text summarization. At its core, coding for NLP is about converting unstructured text into a structured data format that machine learning models can process, and then using those models to derive meaningful insights, power conversational agents, or generate new, coherent text, thereby enabling software to interact with the world in a more human-like manner.

In this chapter we will use the author's early experiments of hand-coding linguistic rules that were mostly the result of David Brill's NLP machine learning experiments.
